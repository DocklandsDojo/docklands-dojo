Welcome to the [_DocklandsDojo_!](http://docklandsdojo.github.io/docklands-dojo/about/) Today you are going to learn to create your first website!

Before getting started, you need to complete the following two steps.

###Step One
You need to download this [starter kit]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/my-first-website.zip) before getting started. It contains
everything you need to get started.

It should download into your Downloads folder and will be called my-first-website.zip

###Step Two
You will need a text editor to create your website. We recommend using Sublime. It is free and can
be [downloaded here](http://www.sublimetext.com/2)
